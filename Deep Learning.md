#### Deep Learning - try to find out the function to tell the underlying rule, can be prediction or classification 
Neural networks (inspired by bio,  并不是生物的神经网络， 只是借用比喻) Model 
F = f4(f3(f2(f1(x)))
- MLP multi layer perceptron  
 解决的问题 
- computer vision e.g. self driving 
- NLP 
- reinforcement learning e.g. AlphaGo 

#### Key Component
- Data (pictures, voice,etc)
  - label - supervised learning
     - classification, regression, recommender system(filtering + ranking), sequence learning(translation, input/data dim is not fixed)
  - without label - unsupervised learning 
     - clustering, PCA
     - self - supervised learning NLP
 - Model 
  - CNN (convolutional neural network)
  - RNN (
  - Attention 
    - volitional cue
    - non-volitional cue
